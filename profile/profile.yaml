# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: |-
  I am a University of Waterloo graduate with a Bachelor of Mathematics in Computational Mathematics and a Minor in Computing. My passion lies in data analysis and software,
  which I further pursued during my co-op terms. I have hands-on experience working as a Data Scientist and as a Data Engineer, where I built AI applications and solved business-driven
  problems. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Linux, and data frameworks such as pandas and PySpark, and I am skilled in translating data solutions into actionable insights. I am 
  currently seeking Data Scientist and Data Engineer roles where I can apply myself and solve complex real-world problems. My proven ability to produce results, from winning a 
  hackathon to pioneering projects as a team lead, demonstrates my ability as a valuable asset in any team. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my background in data science
  and engineering with you.
